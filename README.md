## General Information
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, aims to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors. This analysis helps the company understand how demand varies with different features, enabling management to adjust strategies to meet customer expectations and improve profitability. The dataset includes daily bike demand influenced by weather, seasonality, and other factors.

Objective is to create model to know the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
